			'<p>After a hard day at work, I came back and took a hammer and crowbar to explore what the ceiling was made of and how we would get the stuff off.  Turns out it was indeed the wood we had hoped for, painted white.  The drywall was attached with both nails and screws, with a ton of nails holding the curved metal strip in place to make those rounded corners.</p>' +

We then filled in the holes from the nails and screws with wood filler, sanded the rough spots, and painted the whole thing with primer.</p>' +

			'<p>Trevor saw how disappointed I was, and was excited to open up the washer and investigate what was going on. He found a magical piece of paper that told him the buttons to press to put the washer into \'service mode\', which meant that it did all kinds of things when you spun the dial, like blinking a serial code or spinning or filling with water.  We saw that the hot water filled much faster than the cold, and Trevor quickly diagnosed and fixed the issue: a clogged filter in the cold water input. Now the machine doesn\'t stretch the clothes! Below is Trevor, excited to have fixed the machine.</p>' +

Actually, when we moved in and for the first few days it did work, but at one point I flipped the switch and it just ... didn\'t spin up. This meant our showers made the bathroom more steamy, which probably isn\'t so good for the paint in the long term (not that we want to keep that textured paint around anyway). Yesterday I climbed up on a ladder to fix the fan, assuming it was just too linty to spin. </p>' +

			'<p>During the deconstruction, we decided that the old owners had built this shed originally as a shop or tool shed, because the insides seemed to have yellow pegboard on them. Later, they turned it into a bedroom: the pegboard had been repurposed as a floor, just placed over wooden beams but not attached to them. The shed was carpeted, insulated, finished, and even wallpapered at one time.  It showed signs of having an old hard door with latch, and although there was no electricity we could imagine that someone had slept here. This guess is made more certain by the fact that we know that someone had staying in the garage and in the 8x10 detached back shed.</p>' +
			'<p>My uncle Elliott came over to help with any (de)construction we were doing this weekend. We decided to work on the shed, as the scope of the project seemed appropriate for 3 people in one day. He brought a sledge hammer, gloves, and a lot of extra man-power which made this project possible!</p>' +

Stucco is basically like cement pushed over chicken wire, so it is both heavy and un-crackable without using wire cutters.

The fourth and fifth slots were actually taken too, but by a 240V circuit that was no longer used in the house (old stove?  water heater?  who knows.)

In college I made a <a href=\"http://kaytdek.trevorshp.com/graphics/humming/humming.htm\">feeder</a> from plastic bottles and a red Solo cup for petals, and I had quite a few Anna\'s hummingbirds come visit every day.</p>' +
			'<p>This time, I decided to make a hummingbird feeder from a glass bottle, so I could put it in the dishwasher.  Sugar water makes a great place for nasty things to grow, so it is important to clean the feeder frequently and thoroughly.  For this one, the base and petals are from an empty Tide detergent as the plastic seems hard and sturdy and the colors were bright.  However, the base will not be able to go in the dishwasher, so I tried to have as few nooks and crannies as possible to make it easier to clean later.</p>' +
			'<p>Materials & Tools:<br>1 glass bottle with screw-on lid (I used an Orangina bottle)<br>1 plastic Tide detergent with lid<br>Thin wire<br>Hot glue<br>Drill<br>Needle Nosed Pliers<br>Scissors</p>' +
			'<p>I began by drilling 4 very small holes in the Tide lid to attach to the bottle.  I also drilled 4 very small holes in the bottle lid, and one large hole to let the sugar-water flow out.</p>' +
			'<p>I cut lots of small petals from the tide container, then hot-glued them together to make 6-petaled flowers with holes in the middle for the bird to drink.  I made 4 flowers, then glued them all to my tide lid.</p>' +
			'<p>I then threaded 4 thin wires through the 4 small holes in the Tide lid, and attached each thin wire to a hole of the bottle lid.  In retrospect, I should have done this before attaching the flowers to the Tide lid.</p>' +
			'<p>Finally, I made a loop of thin wire and attached three long pieces of wire to that to hold up the bottle.  I made some sugar-water (1:4 sugar:water, boiled) and put it in my Orangina bottle, then screwed the base on upside down.  I brought it outside, inverted it, and hung it on a nail along a rafter outside the kitchen.</p>' +

Well, ok it was hot and sweaty and exhausting, but it was <i>relatively</i> quick and painless.</p>' +
			'<p>Unlike last time, I had an attack plan: go for the nails.  Each sheet of drywall is nailed (or screwed...I still don\'t understand why both were used) to the underlying tongue and groove wood.  By simply removing the nails and screws, the ceiling should just fall off, right?  Sort of.  The ceiling drywall did come down in much larger pieces than last time we attempted this, but it wasn\'t quite that simple. Sometimes the drywall was stuck to the paint, or I didn\'t find that one rogue screw, or the corner was just too tight to remove the nail.</p>' +
			'<p>I found the fasteners with a strong magnet beforehand and marked them with a grease pencil.  That made my work a lot easier down the road, because I could quickly make my way across the ceiling without needing to switch tools at every nail.  Then it was a lot of pulling and making dust until the ceiling was on the floor.  Luckily, I was ready for the mess and installed plastic sheeting with a fan blowing out the window to manage dust.  The plastic sheet also made clean up easy.  It turns out that stuff goes more smoothly when you plan ahead!</p>' +

			'<p>My parents were in town for the long weekend, and this turned out to be the perfect project for us to tackle.  My dad and I thought a lot about the gate\'s design and eventually came up with a pretty good plan and a nice long shopping list for the home improvement store.  The plan was to attach a post to the house wall and a second post to the existing fence for the other side of the gate.  I really wanted to make the entire gate out of wood, as I don\'t like the look of the welded steel gate frames.  So, at the risk of having a saggy gate in a few years, we bought a bunch of redwood and got to work.</p>' +
			'<p>You know that measure twice, cut once thing?  Pretty good idea.  We cut a beautiful fence post out of a 4x4 redwood post&mdash;slanted top for water run-off, counterbored holes for the lag bolts, it was really nice.  Only we couldn\'t attach it to the wall.  It turns out our house\'s foundation is thick.  Really thick.  And it\'s hard to screw a lag bolt into concrete when you\'re expecting a wooden stud.  We ended up putting the bottom lag bolt hole a little too close to the ground, which prevented us from attaching the post to the house as intended.  So, Katie went out to buy another redwood post and we set to work adapting the oops-post for the other side of the gate.</p>' +
			'<p>Once Katie returned with the lumber, we\'d spent a good 3 hours on the project and had...a post bolted to a fence.  Nice work, team!  Things moved faster after that, especially because we had so much practice making the house-side fence post.  Once both posts were up, we measured the opening and planned out the gate doors.  The span was about 6 feet, so we planned for two doors of equal size.  For added strength (and the illusion of professionalism), I opted for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lap_joint\">half lap joints</a> at the corners of the gate door frames.  It was my first time making such a joint, so I got a brand new dado blade just for that.  It was fairly painless (although time consuming) and I\'m really happy with the result.</p>' +
			'<p>The next day, after the glue dried, we cut the diagonal crossbeams and screwed them in place.  Before adding the fence pickets, we figured out where the hinges would go by temporarily hanging the gates.  Then pulled the gates down and attached the pickets.  After re-installing the gates, we just had to add a latch and cane bolt.  We got our neighbor to help out with the cane bolt hole&mdash;it was cool to see a hammer drill at work!</p>' +

			'<p>After <a href=\"index.html#?start=15&end=16\">removing the ceiling drywall</a>, we spent a few days resurfacing the walls.  They had knock-down texture on them which looked terrible, especially because the walls were painted with high-gloss paint.  You\'d have been able to see your reflection in those walls if it weren\'t for all the texture. Resurfacing the walls involves lots of drywall compound (mud).  Like 40 pounds of it!  The idea is to slowly build up the wall by adding thin layers of watered-down mud, and we ended up adding 3 full layers with a fourth in certain troublesome areas.  It\'s not <i>hard</i> work, but it sure does take a lot of time.  We figured we\'d smooth the walls, paint the room, and get trim up in a weekend.  Yea, right.  After about a week and a half, we finished smoothing the walls.  A lot of the work was done by Katie while I built our new <a href=\"index.html#?start=18&end=19\">fence gate</a>.</p>' +
			'<p>Time to prime and paint!  After a lot of pondering and asking of second opinions, we decided to go with a nice yellow color for the room.  It\'s not a very sunny room, so the yellow made it feel much brighter.  The painting was the easy part&mdash;it went on easy, and looks great!</p>' +
			'<p>The trim was harder.  After cutting what seemed like every piece either too short or at the wrong angle, I finished nailing a 5/8\" cove trim around the ceiling.  I kept getting the newly-painted walls all dirty when I installed the trim, so we would probably swap the order on our next room and really leave the painting for the very end.  Luckily, the paint we bought is scrubbable and I was able to clean it right up.  I wasn\'t too happy with the way the mitered corners turned out.  It was very difficult to deal with walls and corners that weren\'t square...I guess that\'s what caulk is for.</p>' +

			'<p>There was a ceiling fan (with lights) in the yellow room before we made it yellow.  Unfortunately, the wire for that fan was run directly along the main ceiling beam, hidden underneath all the drywall Katie and I removed.  So, we had to figure out a different way to get power to the center of the ceiling for our overhead light.</p>' +
			'<p>After much hemming and hawing, I finally agreed that surface mounted indoor conduit doesn\'t really look that bad.  The plan was to run some conduit alongside main ceiling beam, pressed up against the tongue and groove slats.  In order to do that, I needed just a few more inches of wire.  The proper way to extend wire is to add a junction box somewhere and take new wire (as long as you need) from there.  I found out that junction boxes also have to be accessible, and someone suggested (most brilliantly) that if a junction box is needed somewhere, you might as well install an outlet to serve as the junction.  So I did!</p>' +
			'<p>I added an outlet above the closet in our yellow room, which might actually come in handy if we ever convert the space above the closet to a reading nook.  It was my first time doing electrical work on our new house.  It was also my first time cutting holes in freshly-painted drywall... It took forever to actually find the wire in the wall, as there was some weird wall-on-top-of-wall stuff going on (previous renovations, don\'t ask) that put the wire in a very strange place.  I eventually found that devious wire, cut it short, and popped in an outlet box.  Then, I ran new wire back to the ceiling and through indoor conduit to the center of the room.  Looks great so far, it\'s just missing a light fixture.</p>',

			'<p>Another post about the yellow room!  This time it\'s all about the room\'s window.  The window used to have a granite window stool and rounded corners all around. (I learned that the stool is the proper name for that thing I would have called the sill.  Turns out the sill is only on the outdoor side.)  We wanted a cleaner, crisper look, so we bypassed the fancy window trim at the store and picked up some plain ol\' wood to trim our window like shown here.</p>' +

We got poplar for the stool and apron (bottom two pieces of the trim) and softer pine for the more decorative parts of the trim.</p>' +
			'<p>With all the supplies ready, I got to work!  The 1x8 turned out to be a little too wide for the stool, so I trimmed it down to a 1x6, and made a note to just buy a 1x6 when we do the next window.  I cut out clearance for the jamb using a hand saw, as I couldn\'t think of a good way to do it with power tools.  It actually wasn\'t too bad&mdash;the cuts came out pretty straight in the end.  I also used a router table to round the edges of the stool just a bit for durability and comfort.  All the other pieces were simpler than the stool, as I just had to cut them all to length.  I used 2\" finishing nails to install all the bits, and suddenly the window looked a thousand times better!  I also took the opportunity to fill some gaps around the window with insulating foam and replace all the vinyl edging around the window.</p>' +
			'<p>Katie helped prime the trim and then I stayed up late to paint the whole thing the next night.  The window looks so much better than before; Katie and I love it!</p>',

Easier said than done!  The lighting store ordered a part in the wrong size, so that delayed the project a bit.

While the mini-split is hugely efficient and runs on electric power, we decided to go with another gas heater and invest in insulation instead of an expensive heating system. Our house is pretty small, so hopefully with better insulation and the not-so-cold winters we won\'t need to use very much natural gas at all.</p>' +

		'title': 'Patio Door - Framing',
		'date': 1417203561000,
		'author': 'Trevor',
		'contents' :
			'<p>Originally, our house had no doors (or windows) in the back wall.  We couldn\'t see our backyard, much less get to our backyard from inside the house.  This is the story of how that all changed.</p>' +
			'<p>I spent a long time researching types of patio doors and comparing brands.  We eventually settled on a sliding glass door because it lets a ton of light in and doesn\'t take up space in the room when it\'s open.  After that, I started the planning process.  I used a stud finder to map out the back wall of the sewing room and drew it up on my computer.  There was a possible problem in that the hose bib at the back of the house comes out near where we were planning to install the door.  Through a mixture of voodoo and logical thinking, I convinced myself that there was in fact no water pipe in the portion of the wall that would eventually become a door.  Great!  However, the location of the hose bib did set an upper limit on how wide the door could be: 5 feet.  I was used to 6 foot patio doors, but a bit of research turned up plenty of 5-footers to choose from.</p>' +
			'<p>After talking with someone at Home Depot and a little more internet research, I settled on a nice Simonton brand vinyl sliding door.  The quality was said to be high, and you can\'t beat vinyl for ease-of-maintenance.  I placed the order at Home Depot and then waited (patiently) for the door to arrive.  I certainly didn\'t want to cut a hole in the wall before having the door in hand.  That waiting period was perfect for me to learn all about patio door installation and proper flashing.</p>' +
			'<p>Finally, the door arrived!  It was just as I expected (phew!) and I immediately got to work cutting a huge hole in our house.  I started by just removing the drywall from the interior side of the wall.  That exposed the studs&mdash;just where I thought they would be&mdash;and the cellulose insulation, which I carefully bagged up to use later.  It turned out that our house doesn\'t have sheathing (large sheets of plywood) around it, so I could see the building paper/stucco directly on the other side of the studs.</p>' +
			'<p>Getting a good look inside the wall revealed two things.  First, our house <b>is</b> in fact bolted to the foundation (I can\'t imagine why some houses are not!) for earthquake protection.  Second, a portion of the sill plate (the 2x4 that lays on top of the slab foundation for the wall studs to sit on) was partially rotted out.  I interrupted the project to buy a pressure-treated 2x4 to replace the rotted sill plate and a new reciprocating saw to cut the old sill plate out.  The new saw was a fun toy and made short work of the sill plate replacement.  Once that was sorted out, I could focus on the main task at hand: framing the new doorway.</p>' +
			'<p>I basically had to move one stud 1/2\" to the right, remove three other studs, and add a header across the opening.  I spent a long time figuring out which size header to use.  I eventually settled on two 2x8 beams, which is one size up from what code mandates for a load-bearing wall.  However, as I worked through this project, it became more and more apparent that the wall I was installing the door in was in fact not load-bearing and didn\'t need a large header at all.  Oh well, I guess we\'ve got an over-built doorway that could support a whole second story if it needs to...better safe than sorry-with-a-collapsed-house.  The actual framing was pretty easy, although a few of the nails were hard to put in with the tight working spaces.  I first moved that one stud 1/2\" over, then added the jack studs (the doubled-up stud that supports the header) and finally the header.  As I mentioned, the header is made up of two 2x8 beams which, when stacked together do not actually make a 4x8 due to strange lumber math.  Standard practice is to put a 1/2\" piece of plywood between the two 2x8\'s, so I went ahead and did that.</p>' +
			'<p>Remember the lack of sheathing around our house?  Yea that actually caused a bit of a problem.  Because there was no plywood behind the wet stucco when the house was built, it kind of sagged and bowed into the stud cavities and then dried that way.  That meant the header could not sit flush with its neighboring studs, as the uneven stucco surface behind it refused to cooperate.  I had no choice but to cut out that portion of the stucco in order to situate the header correctly.</p>' +
		       '<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/nw2iT-NJPTo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>' +
		       '<p>Whatever, I was going to be cutting an even bigger hole in the stucco later.  After the header came itsy-bitsy cripple studs above the header.  Those were a pain to put in due to their small stature, and I had to use screws because there was no way I could hammer nails in such a small space.  With the framing done, it was time to knock a hole in the stucco.  But that\'s for another post.</p>',

			'<p>With the patio door opening <a href=\"index.html#?start=28&end=29\">framed</a>, it was time to cut a giant hole in the side of our house!  Katie was a bit nervous about this part, but I had everything lined up so that we\'d only have a gaping hole for a few hours until the new door was actually fixed in place.</p>' +
			'<p>From the inside of the house, I drilled a hole through the stucco at each of the door frame\'s four corners.  That allowed me to locate the new framing from the outside of the house.  I put framing nails through each of the four holes and used a chalk line on the exterior of the house to mark out the soon-to-be doorway.  Then, it was to the point of no return: cutting the stucco.</p>' +
			'<p>I bought a dry masonry blade for my power circular saw to do the majority of the cutting.  The masonry blade really did the trick.  It cut through the tough stucco like butter, although it produced a TON of dust and was really loud.</p>' +
			'<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/JEEoL__lle0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>' +
			'<p>Eventually, we got to the point where most of the opening was cut, and the slab of stucco was just hanging on by a thread (well, technically it was hanging by the metal lath embedded in the stucco).  A quick snip with a pair of wire cutters sent the piece of our wall crashing to the ground.  Katie was inside at the time to ensure the wall fell <i>outward</i> instead of back into the house.</p>' +
			'<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/nTHMvNEhGXQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>' +
			'<p>Now, with the main opening cut, I started preparing the surrounding area for the door.  I removed some more stucco to reveal the studs beneath, as the door had a nailing flange around the perimeter.  Katie and I then applied peel-n-stick flashing all around the opening to keep water out.  Finally, it was time to put the door in!  There was only one problem...the door weighed about 200 pounds!</p>' +
			'<p>Well after calling some friends over to help and removing one of the glass panels, we got the door in place.  I put silicone caulk all around the perimeter and on the bottom sill plate to make the installation water-tight.  Then we all lifted the door and gently set it into the opening.  Like a glove!  It fit perfectly into the hole and I got to work squaring it up with shims and nailing the flange all around.  By now it was pretty dark outside, but we were determined to have a working (and locking) door for the night, so we kept on truckin\'.  We put the glass panel we had removed back in place and Katie installed the handle and strike plate.  It was looking great so far, and operated nicely.  It was time to call it a day.</p>' +
			'<p>Later, I filled the space around the door with expanding foam from the interor side and started preparing for the stucco patch work on the exterior.  After lots of research on stucco techniques, I felt pretty good about tackling the patch ourselves.</p>' +
			'<p>I actually ended up chipping away more of the stucco around the door to make a more irregular edge with some of the metal lath (chicken wire) exposed.  That would help the patch bond to the existing stucco and help to prevent cracks down the road.  I installed new lath around the door as well as a J-channel to create a 3/8\" expansion joint around the new door.  After that, it was time to stucco.  Katie and I each worked on one side of the door and after a pretty steep learning curve, we were applying stucco like pros!  It turned out the breakthrough technology was a wet sponge.  It smoothed out the new stucco and blended it pretty seamlessly into the old stucco\'s texture.  We worked slowly, mixing about 1/3 of a 50 lb bag of stucco mix at a time.  The methodical work and attention to detail really paid off though.  The new stucco blends very well into the old, and with a new coat of paint should be completely invisible.</p>' +
			'<p>So that\'s it!  The saga of the patio door.  Katie and I are extremely pleased with the door.  It really brightens up the room and gives us easy access to our backyard.</p>',

			'<p>Our bathroom has, no <i>had</i>, granite halfway up the bathroom walls and almost all the way up the shower walls.  Katie and I have a lot of plans for our bathroom, but before we could get to work, we had to remove those slabs of granite glued to the walls.</p>' +
			'<p>There wasn\'t much to it&mdash;just a crowbar and some elbow grease.  Upon starting, Katie reminded me that granite is really heavy.  \"Yea, yea,\" I said.  \"I\'ll figure it out,\" I said.  Well.  I worked the crowbar into the crack between the granite and the wall, always working directly in front of a stud so I didn\'t punch the crowbar through the underlying drywall.  I slowly worked the slab back and forth until eventually I felt the bond give way and the slab pull free from the wall.  Hooray!  My elation did not last long as I caught the granite and felt the weight of it.  All of it.  I learned that granite is really heavy that day.</p>' +
			'<p>After a lot of hemming and hawing, I grabbed a dinky rolling base for an indoor plant.  It was the only dolly-like thing we owned, and so I put it to work.  Katie helped me maneuver the slab through the house and over some small bumps before putting it outside to await it\'s final Craigslist destiny.  The \"dolly\" made it through the ordeal, but just barely.</p>' +
			'<p>The first slab didn\'t have any obstructions, but the next two wouldn\'t come out with the toilet and sink still in place.  Those came out easily and the remaining slabs were not too bad after my lessons learned from the first one.   Now our bathroom is a construction zone, but at least we\'re one step further to a better bathroom!</p>',

		'title': 'The Bathroom Demolition Continues',
		'date': 1421388315000,
		'author': 'Trevor',
		'contents' :
			'<p>Originally, I was planning to have rewired the house by now.  However, Katie helpfully pointed out that many of the new circuits will be running in the wall behind our shower.  The other side of that wall is stucco, so we\'d have to access it from the inside to run wires.  That meant we would have to remove the shower to rewire the house.  Well, we weren\'t too keen on ripping out the shower with no plan in sight to replace it, so the rewiring got put on hold and we have been working on our bathroom plan.</p>' +
			'<p>The first step of that plan was to gut the current bathroom, and that\'s just what we did!  In addition to the granite that lined the bathroom walls, the entire shower alcove was granite.  It all had to go.</p>' +
			'<p>First, Katie and I took out the shower doors&mdash;that was easy.  Next, we had to pull out the shower curb (also granite).  That was a bit harder, but with a lot of sledge hammer and pry bar work, we got it out.  On to the bigger and better things: the walls.  Each of the shower\'s side walls was a large, continuous slab of very heavy granite.  Luckily, the slab had a piece of decorative trim that made it look thicker than it actually was.  I started at the top of the piece and slowly pried the slab from the wall.  Katie cut away the caulk and removed that decorative trim piece.  Eventually we discovered that there was a thick slab of (also pretty heavy) lath and mortar behind the granite.  Well, after lots of careful prying we got the granite separated (mostly) from the mortar and the mortar separated from the wall.  We wrestled the granite into submission on a moving dolly and brought that sucker out of the house!  The other shower wall went about the same, except that the granite got a bit jammed on the shower head pipe.  We ended up cracking that one into a few pieces to get it off the wall.</p>' +
			'<p>The back wall had an even larger piece of granite, and that one pretty quickly cracked in half as I pried it.  It actually helped us out quite a bit, as it was much easier to remove two halves of a huge granite wall than it would have been to remove the whole thing at once.  That\'s not to say there weren\'t some scary moments as the 200 pound slab hung 4 feet off the ground, supported only by a corner...</p>' +
			'<p>The final step was to remove the shower floor.  This was interesting.  The shower had a slate (or something like that) floor.  We removed that and under it?  Granite!  That\'s right, there was even hidden granite in this house.  So we removed that granite and underneath that was a 2 inch thick slab of lath and mortar.  We removed that and underneath was another layer of mortar. We chipped that off to finally reveal the slab foundation.  It sure was nice to see the bare concrete staring back at us.</p>' +
			'<p>I also came back a few days later to take up the granite bathroom floor.  It was a fairly easy job and after Katie and I brought it outside, we celebrated the final piece of granite removed from our small bathroom.  That bathroom has to be at least 1 ton lighter than it was.</p>',

			'<p>We knew the kitchen plumbing needed to be redone when we moved into the house. The inspections showed the sink drain assembly was installed incorrectly: the \"drain connection to double sink has [a] reverse slope and fittings are install backwards\" (Plumbing inspection report). The kitchen drain outlet through the cabinet was too high to allow a disposal to be installed. In addition the dishwasher drain line was not installed correctly.</p>' +
			'<p>As we were deconstructing the bathroom we realized we should take the opportunity to fix the kitchen plumbing. All the pipes were accessible through the bathroom wall, which we were going to need to patch and fix anyway.</p>' +
			'<p>Trevor stayed up late one night to cut a new, lower hole for the drain in the back of the cabinet. When I got up in the morning I found a note on the sink saying there was only a bucket instead of a drain and to be careful with how much water I used! But by the evening, Trevor had already finished assembling the new drain -- this time with a correct slope, good P-trap and an inlet for the dishwasher drain. And we made it tall enough to take a disposal later, which will be a great upgrade.</p>' +
			'<p>We did the dishwasher drain after the sink, running a hose at a slight downward slant from a new air gap through two cabinets and to the back of the dishwasher. This involved drilling some holes in the cabinets at awkward angles, and sitting fully inside a cabinet to cut the old drain pipe and support the new drain hose.</p>' +

			'<p>We have taken a lot of stuff out of the house (granite, ceiling drywall, granite, stucco & studs from the back door, granite) but put very little back in. The tub was the second major thing to be installed after the heater.</p>' +
			'<p>Before we began removing the granite shower we had to purchase a bathtub to replace it. We didn\'t want to be without a way to shower for too long! We decided to go with a shower over a tub instead of another walk-in shower because we felt it added some value to our small, one-bathroom house. After an arduous Pinterest session, we decided we wanted a modern bathroom with a white, clean-lined tub, white subway tiles behind the shower, large grey tiles on the floor, and colorful walls (although paint colors are still far in our future). We found two tub contenters - the acrylic <a href=\"http://www.maax.com/en/products/bathtubs/new/rubix\">Maax Rubix</a> and a cast-iron tub that looked very similar.</p>' +
			'<p><center><a href=\"https://cantileverdesign.wordpress.com/2010/01/25/mid-century-makeover/\"><img src=\"https://cantileverdesign.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/img_07071.jpg?w=640\" width=\"200px\"></a><br><br/><a href=\"https://cantileverdesign.wordpress.com/2010/01/25/mid-century-makeover/\">This bathroom</a> is the most similar to what we want to create, with white subway tiles, glass tub door, floating wood vanity, large mirrored medicine cabinet, and modern fixtures.<br></center></p>' +
			'<p>We were able to see both tubs at a kitchen and bath supply store nearby. Although we love the feel of cast-iron, the sales associate helpfully pointed out that the 600lb cast-iron tub was unlikely to be easy to install, especially if we were going to do it ourselves. She also pointed out that the acrylic tub is actually pretty easy to fix if it gets scratched - you just polish it again!</p>' +
			'<p>We went with the Maax Rubix, and got a taller version which gave us a few more inches to work with when adjusting the plumbing. But the plumbing, which Trevor did, deserves its own post later.</p>' +
			'<p>To install the tub, we actually put it in place three times. Luckily it was really light! The first time, we made sure we could put it in and that it would fit. The second time, we tested that the drain pipes were in the right place, and measured the height of the tiling flange so that we could install a wood strip to level it. The third time, Trevor mixed up some mortar to go under the tub and support the bottom, carefully piled it in the appropriate places, and then we gently laid the tub in place.</p>' +
			'<p>We then screwed the tiling flange into the studs and waited three days for the mortar to dry before testing it out. Then Trevor set up plumbing to the the Hansgrohe Thermostatic Trim Control and Diverter (the thingy that mixes the hot and cold water and controls pressure). Then we hung plastic over the studs to act like the shower walls, and along a string to act like a curtain, and we had a working shower!</p>',

			'<p>Katie already posted about the <a href=\"index.html#?start=33&end=34\">bathtub installation</a>, but before we actually got the tub in place, we did a lot of plumbing work.  We had to replace the shower rough-in valve and supply lines as well as move the drain a few inches towards the wall.</p>' +
			'<p>Step one was moving the drain.  I had thought maybe we could get away with the drain in its existing location due to the fact that we bought an \"above floor rough\" tub.  That means it has extra space underneath the bottom of the tub for pipes.  Sadly, it was not enough space.</p>' +
			'<p>That drain was embedded in the slab foundation, but it had to move.  I fitted my circular saw with a masonry blade and started cutting through the concrete around the drainage pipe.  I figured the slab would be 3-4\" thick; a few passes with the circular saw and some well-placed strikes with the ol\' sledgehammer would to get the job done.  Yea, that was a nice fantasy.  All said and done, it took me a week of hitting the same square foot of concrete for hours after work to even break through.  That was the hardest concrete I have ever met.  Also, in the area immediately around the drainage pipe, the slab was 8-9\" thick!  By the end, my arms were sore, my back was sore, my legs were sore, my thumb was smashed&mdash;I was a wreck.  But at least the drain pipe was free and I could install a new p-trap and drain.  I bought all the necessary fittings and did many test fits before finally gluing it all up and setting the drain assembly in place.</p>' +
			'<p>The shower plumbing wasn\'t too hard.  Once we got the rough-in valve, I carefully mapped out all the fittings and adapters I needed and picked them up at the store.  Many of the joints were to be soldered, although those going directly into the valve would be threaded.  It was my first time doing plumbing soldering, which isn\'t all that different from electronics soldering&mdash;just more fire.  Since it was for potable water, I had to use lead-free solder.  I\'ve heard a lot about the difficulties using lead-free solder (and experienced them in electronics soldering), but I had no choice.  There definitely was a bit of a learning curve, but I really got the hang of it after a few joints.</p>' +
			'<p>One of the threaded joints at the rough-in valve caused a bit of a headache.  When I turned the water back on after finishing the shower plumbing, there was the world\'s smallest leak coming from one of those threaded joints. It was suuuuper slow (maybe 2 drips per day) but definitely there.  Because of the way everything was soldered together, there was no way to tighten the fitting!  I tried to find some sealants that could go on after installation, but didn\'t find anything that I could trust.  Then, I read online that those threaded joints sometimes seal themselves. Ok...worth a shot.  I put a cup under the fitting to catch any drips and keep track of the leak.  Sure enough, the fitting stayed bone-dry after a few days!  I can\'t explain it, but I\'m sure glad everything worked out in the end.</p>' +
			'<p>Once we had the tub in place, I flushed the system and test filled the tub.  The tub held just fine, and there were no leaks!</p>',

The installation was pretty simple&mdash;just a few holes and some caulk to hold the numbers in place.  The numbers are brushed nickel in a plain, simple font.  They look great, and we can\'t wait for the rest of the house to look as good.</p>' +
			'<p>We also (on a whim) bought the fixin\'s for a doorbell at the hardware store this weekend.  As it turned out, we actually already had a chime laying around from some trip to a thrift store a long time ago, so we only needed to buy the switch that goes next to the door and a small transformer that steps down the main 120V power to 16V for the chime.  It was a fun little project this morning to install all the pieces and have a working doorbell after a few hours.  We can\'t wait for someone to come visit and test out our improvement.</p>',

			'<p>Upon moving in, our house was equipped with a grand total of three circuits.  I\'d turn on power tools in the garage and our hallway light would dim.  There was a power strip permanently plugged in to a kitchen counter outlet so that the microwave and stove had power.  Our hallway light had no light switch.  Literally none.  We had to unscrew the bulb to turn it off.  Outlets were the 3-prong variety without the having the third prong actually connected to anything, which can be unsafe.  We only had a few outlets in each room.  I think you get the idea.</p>' +
			'<p>Katie and I knew we wanted to redo the electrical pretty much from day one.  I spent a really long time pondering the best way to run new wires in a house with no attic and no crawlspace.  I thought maybe you could pull new wires through the walls where the old wires already were (that was woefully naive of me).  I learned that often new wires are run on top of the roof and then down into the walls, but I didn\'t like the idea of conduit criss-crossing the roof or the exterior walls.  That left me with tearing down drywall and pulling new wires through the walls on the inside of the house.  I didn\'t remove all the drywall, just enough to gain access to the parts of the walls where new wires would be.</p>' +
			'<p>The drywall removal and wall prep was really a project of its own, but frankly not all that exciting for you folks to read about so it\'s lumped in with this post.  I mapped out where all the wires would be and then marked out swaths of drywall for removal.  I had a great plan to use a Dremel rotary tool with a drywall cutter to make quick and precise work of the demolition.  As usual, that plan did not work in the slightest.  The Dremel continually jammed on the ancient (and dense) drywall and I ended up cutting all the drywall out with a very manual hand saw.</p>' +
			'<p>In order to know where to cut, I had made a wiring plan.  That plan was months in the making, as we had to decide exactly where we wanted new outlets and I had to spend hours with the electrical code deciding which circuits were necessary, what the proper wiring techniques are, and so forth.  It felt really good to finally take that plan over to our city development office and get a big ol\' stamp of approval to begin work.  The plan came in real handy throughout the entire rewiring project.</p>' +
			'<p>After removing the drywall (and insulation on exterior walls), I drilled a ton of new holes in the studs and started pulling wires through.  After a lot of pulling, grunting, and cursing I got all the wires pulled through the walls.  Pulling the wires through wall corners was especially challenging and there were a lot of corners.  I also had to reconstruct a small partition wall between two bedrooms in the process because it was not built to accommodate electrical wiring.  Then I had to re-reconstruct it because I screwed up and the wall was out of whack.</p>' +
			'<p>Once the wiring was run, I installed wall boxes that house the junctions and outlets.  Then I prepped each of those boxes by cutting the protruding wire to length and stripping the ends.  The final step before my first inspection was to wire the neutral wires at the main breaker panel.  Once the rough inspection passed, I wired up all the outlets and switches at each of the wall boxes and connected the hot wires to the breakers to make all the circuits in the house live.  It felt great to plug stuff in to our new electrical system!</p>' +
			'<p>In all, I added 11 new circuits for a total of 14 circuits in the house.  Three of those are for electric appliances (hot water heater, dryer, and range) that are currently gas.  We don\'t know if we\'ll switch to electric appliances, but seeing as fossil fuels are on the way out and the house walls were open anyways, we opted to run the wiring just in case.  We added a 3-way light switch for our hallway light, put more outlets in the garage, bedrooms, kitchen, and bathroom, and balanced our house\'s electrical load across circuits in a much better way than the initial three circuits allowed.</p>' +
			'<p>I think the length of this post reflects the size of our rewiring project.  The first project I started thinking about after moving was the electrical rewire.  After 7 months I finally started on the actual work, and it was another 2 months of work to get all the wires and outlets installed.  Parts of it were very frustrating, but it was also incredibly rewarding to turn on all those circuits for the first time and test each new outlet.  I can safely say that having rewired one house, I will never do it again.</p>',

			'<p>After the extensive electrical work, Katie and I were left with a ton of holes in our walls.  You could see between rooms and the bathroom was no longer entirely private.  I set to work patching all the holes I had cut in our drywall.  The process is not too complicated.  The basic idea is to cut a piece of drywall the same shape and size as the hole and screw it to the wall.  It was pretty time-consuming but not much manual labor.  That was nice after all the difficulties I had pulling wires through our walls!</p>' +
			'<p>Drywall sheets come as 4 ft x 8 ft sheets, which is too large to fit in a normal car (much less the bicycle I usually ride to the home improvement stores).  Without a friend\'s pickup truck to borrow, I opted to rent a truck from Home Depot.  We only needed 10 sheets of drywall. You would usually need something like that for just a single room if you were putting up drywall in a new house, but we were just patching select areas.  Even for only a few sheets, the truck was worth it!</p>' +
			'<p>I worked on one room at a time, although I didn\'t patch the garage&mdash;the drywall was done terribly in there by the previous owners, so we may just redo it all at some point.  It sure felt good to patch up those holes, and it\'ll look even better once the patches are seamlessly blended into the wall surface and painted over.</p>' +
			'<p>We installed the drywall over studs with no insulation between them.  Our house has cellulose insulation, which is actually still a pretty good choice.  Katie and I decided to get all the drywall done and then blow in insulation later through small access holes (or maybe hire someone to do it...).  Many other areas of the house are not insulated adequately anyways, so we figured we might as well do the insulation for the entire house at once.  There were a few small areas where it made more sense to just pack leftover insulation by hand, but for the most part we will blow it in later.  I did take the opportunity to seal up a bunch of gaps between the ceiling and the walls with expanding foam before patching the drywall.</p>',

			'<p>The electrical work is finally out of the way (and signed off by the inspector!), so we can start to put our bathroom back together again.  The first course of action is to tile around the tub and get our shower in working order.  Before we could lay tiles, we had to prepare the walls with tar paper and cement board.</p>' +
			'<p>I stapled a few sheets of tar paper to the studs surrounding the tub.  Tar paper is (as you may have guessed) impregnated with tar, making it quite waterproof.  It creates a waterproof barrier between the shower and the inner walls.  Without it, water would eventually seep through the tile grout and sit against the studs.  That\'s bad, as it leads to moldy walls and rotting wood.  So up the tar paper went!  It was pretty easy, though I did have to tear it down and start over after making a poor measurement.</p>' +
			'<p>After the tar paper came cement board.  These are 1/2 inch thick \"boards\" of cement&mdash;cement poured between two layers of fiberglass mesh.  The cement gives structure while the fiberglass keeps the brittle cement from cracking.  Cement board is not waterproof, but it can get wet without losing strength or growing mold.  Cement board is fairly heavy, so Katie gave me a hand holding it in place while I screwed it in.  The full boards went up fast, but I spent a while on a shower niche for shampoo bottles and such things.  It was a lot of measuring and cutting, but I had the whole niche covered in cement board before too long.  Since the cement board sheets are only 3 ft x 5 ft, there were seams between discrete sheets on the wall.  I taped those up with some fiberglass mesh and filled the gap with tile mortar.</p>' +
			'<p>The last step was to waterproof the niche.  Because there was no way to ensure an unbroken tar paper barrier throughout the niche, it had to be waterproofed from the outside.  For this, I used some cool paint-on waterproof membrane called RedGard.  It is like a thick paint that goes on bright pink and dries into a rubbery red membrane.  Two coats of that, and there\'s never going to be any water leaking through that niche!</p>' +
			'<p>We are looking forward to tiling the shower and eventually turning our bathroom into a nice space again.</p>',

			'<p>Where there had been a cement sidewalk in the back yard, we sculpted the straight border of the grass to give it a more interesting shape. We then went on a shopping spree and got some low-water flowering plants: petite Lily of the Nile, Cape Honeysuckle, Rock Rose and Sweet Broom. We planted these in the back with plenty of space for growth -- the Cape Honeysuckle could get up to 20ft tall (with support) and the Rock Rose could be over 4ft in diameter! And these plants are not just beautiful for our enjoyment, but they will also attract bees and hummingbirds, who are always on the lookout for more flowers in the drought.</p>' +
			'<p>We also got some big, beautiful pots that Trevor\'s parents kindly got us as a (super early) birthday present. We planted in these a Gardenia, a purple Calla Lily, and our old mint which was ready for a bigger pot. These beautiful pots and plants make our house look more interesting and pleasant from the street! We also re-purposed some of our other pots (after transplanting their occupants) for a pink Begonia, a hanging Fuchsia and some pretty relative of a Daisy.</p>' +
			'<p>In the front shady garden bed, we\'ve got some sort of large-leaved potential lily which has been growing without any of our help. Lorraine had put river rocks around this plant last time she was here, and this time we added some succulents from a yard sale! These should grow well in that shady corner of the house; we mixed a lot of sand and dirt into the soil that was there, and they are supposed to be hardy plants.</p>' +
			'<p>In addition to all the decorative landscaping, we also worked on the raised vegetable beds. The plants in there hadn\'t really been thriving -- in fact many seemed to be slowly dying perhaps due to a lack of nutrients. We amended the soil with potting soil, bat guano and composted steer manure, and replanted many of the plants with the hope that this time will go better. We also transplanted an old rosemary into the garden bed, finding as we did so that it had totally outgrown it\'s old pot -- the root ball was huge!</p>' +

			'<p>And since we are on the topic of plants, a quick update on our fruit trees!<br>The fruit trees around the house are really getting into the spirit of spring. The avocado may never have mature fruit but it sure has a lot of thumbnail sized ones. The peach tree has quite a few green fuzzy peaches, although there are more on the ground with squirrel chew marks on them. The nectarine looks healthy this year. The lemons are doing great, as usual. And both apple trees have a lot of itty bitty apples and lots of sun to make them big and sweet.</p>',

			'<p>Katie and I found a nice brushed metal mail slot to replace the outdated and rusty mailbox, so my dad and I spent the day installing that.  It was a bit of a custom installation, because the mail slot was intended to be installed in a door.  We wanted to install it in the garage wall, which is quite a bit thicker than a standard door.  The tricky bit was fabricating some sort of chute that would allow the mail to pass through the wall without opening up the inside of the wall to the elements.</p>' +
			'<p>We figured we\'d somehow make a chute out of wood and metal flashing, but put all that logical planning aside for a moment as we power sawed a hole through our garage wall.  I used my circular saw and masonry blade to very carefully cut out a rectangular hole we had traced onto the wall from the mail slot cover piece.  After the main cuts were made, I chiseled out the sharp corners to complete the mail slot hole.</p>' +
			'<p>With the hole there, it was much easier to visualize how a chute might work, especially because we could actually hold the mail slot hardware where it would eventually be mounted.  We settled on a simple box that would fit between existing studs and provide a place for the mail slot hardware to screw on to.  After extensive internet research, we also decided to slope the bottom of the chute at an angle of 25 degrees for optimum mail sliding. It was a little tricky working with the sloped bottom, but we got the chute put together after an hour or so.</p>' +
			'<p>The next step was to design and create a metal piece that would both seal the chute from the elements and provide a nice smooth surface for the letters and magazines.  We bought some aluminum flashing (essentially just sheet metal) from the hardware store and then proceeded to spend a lot of time hemming and hawing our way through a fairly complicated folded metal liner.  In the end it came out just fine, and we glued it in place without issue.</p>' +
			'<p>Finally, Katie helped attach the actual mail slot hardware to the wall and we sealed around that with silicone caulk for waterproofing.  It was a really fun project, especially thinking though and building the custom mail chute.  Plus, the outside of our house looks much better than it used to!</p>',

		'contents' :
			'<p>After many weeks showering at work (even on the weekends...) we finally have a working shower again!  Katie and I finished the shower tile a few days ago, and it\'s looking great.  Here is our epic tale.</p>' +
			'<p>It took a long time to find the tiles we wanted, but we got them in the end.  The tiles are 4\" x 8\" matte white subway tiles.  We thought the slightly larger subway tile would match the somewhat contemporary style of the house, and the matte white would keep the tiles different enough from the bathtub that the non-matching whites wouldn\'t be an issue.  I wrote a little <a href=\"https:www.github.com/trevorshannon/tiler\">program</a> to figure out how the tiles would be laid, that that helped us determine exactly how many tiles to buy.  It was especially helpful for determining the number of edge bullnose tiles.  We bought all those tiles and then got started!</p>' +
			'<p>Starting at the back wall, I carefully screwed a nice, straight piece of wood to the shower wall at the right height for the second row of tiles to rest on.  This ensured a level starting surface, as bathtubs are often not flat and level (ours was no exception).  The bottom-most row of tiles is actually put in all the way at the end, after removing that wood piece.  Next, I temporarily put on a row of tiles just to see how everything lined up.  I had to adjust my starting position a few times until I was happy with the tile positions.  When laying tile, the position of the first tile entirely defines the rest of the tile positions.  If we weren\'t careful about exactly where that first tile went, we could have ended up with tiny slivers of tile in the corners or strange misalignments at the shampoo niche.  I took this opportunity to mark the wall with lots of horizontal and vertical guidelines according to the tile pattern.  Lots of triple-checking later, I was off and tiling.</p>' +
			'<p>The process was pretty straightforward and actually a lot of fun.  I mixed up a small batch of mortar and applied that to the wall such that it filled two full rows.  Then, I placed a tile so that it lined up with one of my vertical guidelines.  After that, I placed the other row\'s tiles, spacing the tiles apart from each other with small plastic spacers.  After completing two rows, I threw away any leftover mortar and mixed a fresh batch for the next two rows and repeated all the way up the wall.  The back wall went really quickly, and felt kind of like putting together building blocks.  The hardest part was making sure the tiles all sat in the same plane&mdash;that is to say none of the tiles sat closer to the wall than others.  Luckily, there\'s a cool notched trowel you use to apply the mortar that ensures the mortar is always at a uniform thickness. However, there\'s still a bit of play depending on how hard you push the tile into the wall, so I just had to keep my eye on it.</p>' +
			'<p>Katie came in to help out with the two side walls.  I did all the tile cutting using a borrowed wet saw and she did all the mortar and tile placement.  The wall with the shampoo niche was a bit of a pain, because I had to cut a lot of the tiles.  The other wall had pipes sticking out of the wall, so that made it a bit tricky as well.  In order to cut around the pipes, I used a manual rod saw and a little bit of guesswork.  Katie startled me with this stealth video showing the manual cutting process:</p>' +
			'<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PeZ6yVMnjJw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>' +
			'<p>A week or two later and all three tub surround walls had tiles on them! I saved the actual shampoo niche for the end, mostly because we needed to order custom glass shelves for inside the niche.  Since those shelves get embedded between the tiles, I didn\'t want to place the niche tiles until we had the glass in hand.  Once that was the case, I got to work on the niche.  It involved lots of cutting, and some of the cuts were pretty intricate.  It was certainly slow-going, but totally worth it in the end, as the niche looks awesome.</p>' +
			'<p>By this point, there was light at the end of the tunnel.  All the tiles were in place, and only the grout remained.  Well unfortunately for us, nobody local carried the epoxy grout we wanted to use, and so we had to order it online.  I very anxiously waited around until the grout came in and then got to work grouting for the first time ever.  Epoxy grout is a little different from standard cement-based grout, but it\'s way more stain resistant, never needs to be sealed, and is less porous.  Rather than mixing some powder with water, epoxy grout comes as a resin, a hardener, and a colored filler that all get mixed together.  After an hour or so, the grout starts to harden until it\'s rock-solid after about two days.  I worked with small batches, carefully measuring out the proper ratios of resin, hardener, and filler.  I definitely didn\'t want to be in the middle of grouting when it started setting up!  After mixing the grout, I pushed it into all the tile spaces and wiped away the excess.  Following the directions very carefully, I did an initial wash about 20 minutes later to remove extra grout from the tile surface and smooth out the grout lines.  About an hour after that came the final wash to remove any traces of epoxy from the tiles.  It took four batches to do the whole shower over about 3 days.</p>' +
			'<p>After grouting, Katie installed the tub filler, control valve, and shower head.  Adding those bits of chrome really dressed up the shower!  Last came the part where I eagerly anticipated the 48 hour grout drying period to expire.  When the time finally came, I had what was probably the nicest shower I\'d had in quite a while.</p>',

			'<p>This project technically started a long time ago.  The drainpipe leaving the under-the-sink cabinet was not positioned low enough to accommodate a sink disposal.  So, when we removed the bathroom wall granite and started the electrical work, I seized the opportunity to adjust that drainpipe location since the drywall was already open.  Fast forward a few months, and I finally installed a disposal.</p>' +
			'<p>Since the drainpipe was now low enough for the disposal, installation was a breeze.  After carefully choosing my plumbing fittings at the hardware store, discovering I had purchased the wrong piece halfway through, and extra-carefully choosing a replacement at the hardware store, I managed to get the disposal installed.  The process involved removing the existing drain, installing the drain that comes with the disposal, and then locking the actual disposal motor on to that drain.  Then I hooked up all the plumbing, and (since I had already installed a switched outlet under the sink in the rewire) simply plugged in the disposal.</p>' +
			'<p>The disposal only took an hour or so to install, and we\'re really satisfied with it.  We got a disposal that was supposed to be a bit quieter than normal, and I was pleasantly surprised at how quiet is actually is.</p>',

		'contents' :
			'<p>We\'re slowly working through all the projects to finally finish the bathroom.  The latest project was tiling the floor.  Katie and I picked out our tiles months ago, but we only just now got to the actual installation.  We also decided we might as well install an electric heating element under the tiles, because it\'s a rare opportunity with all the floor coverings removed.</p>' +
			'<p>Before any tiling began, we had to install that heating element.  After lots of research, I decided to first lay down a thin sheet of cork on the slab before adding the heating wire.  The cork acts as an insulator to prevent the concrete slab foundation from sucking out all the heat.  With the cork, we expect a more efficient heating system that has a faster heat-up time.  The cork goes down on top of a really thin layer of thinset mortar and has to dry for about 24 hours without being disturbed.  Unfortunately, that meant Katie and I were the proud owners of a totally useless bathroom for 24 hours, and so we ended up staying with a friend (who had a working toilet).  The heating wire installation was up next.</p>' +
			'<p>It is no good to have a heating wire that\'s too long or too short, as you can\'t cut or extend the wire.  I did a scale drawing on my computer and spent a lot of time getting the dimensions right before ordering the roll of wire.  They also sell the wires embedded in a mesh to make a sort of heating pad, but I couldn\'t find a stock size that would work for our bathroom.  Manually laying the bare wire is more time-consuming, but it didn\'t really matter since the bathroom is small.  Katie and I both worked on installing the wire, and everything went according to the plan.  We had just enough wire, and it went down without a hitch.</p>' +
			'<p>The next layer in our floor sandwich was self leveling cement.  This is a pretty thin and watery cement that you can use to fill in any low spots in the floor.  We used it to fully cover the heating wires and provide a nice smooth surface to mark the tile guidelines and make tile installation easier.  The self leveler is pretty goopy stuff, so we did have to push it around with a little homemade squeegee to fully cover the floor.  After another 24 hours of cure time (and 24 hours of no bathroom...) we had a pretty darn level floor with (working!) electric heating embedded.  Once the wires are embedded in the cement, there is no getting them out.  I must have checked the wires 10 times before finally pouring the cement!</p>' +
			'<p>After all this, it was finally time to tile.  Using my shower tiling experience as a reference, I figured it wouldn\'t take that long to do the tiling since we were using large format tiles (12\" x 24\") over a pretty small area.  Well, it turns out laying little tiny subway tiles around the tub is pretty different from huge tiles on the floor.  Space was cramped, and each tile took much longer to set and level due to its size.  I had to be really careful about keeping each tile on the level so that we didn\'t end up with toe-stubbing tile corners rising up from our bathroom floor.  I tiled only a small portion at a time so that we could still walk (or hop, really) around our bathroom while carefully avoiding the newly-laid tiles.  After a few days, the tile was complete and looking really good!  The final step is to grout between the tiles, and our grout just came in the mail so I am looking forward to fully completing the floor.  We still have not fired up the floor heat due to high ambient temperatures and the fact that we haven\'t yet installed the floor\'s thermostat.  Hopefully we\'ll try it out soon!</p>',

			'<p>We bought a sink basin ages ago from Ikea, but I only recently got around to building a cabinet for it.  After some research and browsing lots of images on Pinterest, we decided on walnut for the vanity material.  I found a supplier of pre-finished walnut plywood locally, so I borrowed a big van and picked up a full 4 ft x 8 ft sheet of it.  It was nice to used pre-finished wood, because it would have been hard to get a professional-quality clear coat without professional-quality tools.</p>' +
			'<p>I was a bit scared to get started&mdash;I was afraid I would scratch the beautiful finished wood!  I eventually got up the courage to make some cuts, but not before cleaning the workshop really well and covering the table saw with clean paper.  The last thing I wanted was a piece of grit to get stuck under the wood while I pushed it through the table saw.</p>' +
			'<p>I designed the cabinet to be pretty simple with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket-hole_joinery\">pocket screws</a> holding everything together.  That meant there weren\'t too many complex cuts or joints, just simple passes through the table saw.  I was careful to cut the sides and cabinet doors from the same length of wood.  That way, when the doors are closed, the grain lines up perfectly around the whole cabinet.</p>' +
			'<p>After all the cutting was done, I drilled holes for the pipes, shelf supports, and the pocket screws.  I also had to apply edgebanding to any cut plywood edge that would have shown.  The edgebanding is a thin strip of matching wood used to cover the plywood \"sandwich\" that\'s revealed when you look at the wood edge-on.  I assembled everything with no glue, as it wouldn\'t stick to the wood\'s clear coat anyways.  By this time the cabinet was really taking shape, and I was really happy with how it looked.</p>' +
			'<p>Mounting the cabinet to the wall was a bit tricky, but the task was made easier with some photos of the underlying wall framing that I took during our electrical rewire project.  I drilled carefully placed holes through our brand new tile into the wall studs for the lag bolts that would hold the entire cabinet to the wall.  After transferring the hole pattern onto the cabinet with a paper stencil, I drilled holes in the back face of the cabinet and set it up on the wall.  Katie helped screw in all the bolts (6 in total) and put the sink basin in place.  The final step was to install the faucet and drain, which Katie took care of.</p>' +

Most of it is plywood so that it can handle the humidity of being outdoors, but the facia and door are solid wood. I\'m really proud of the door -- it is made of four pieces of wood, with a groove routed along the edge of each 45deg corner for another piece of wood to wedge in and form a solid joint. The back of the door is routed down so that the plexiglass window sits exactly in it, leading to a really tidy and solid finished door!</p>' +
			'<p>After cutting, screwing, glueing, and sanding, I primed and painted the whole library in three colors: grey for the body, cream for the roof, facia, door and interior, and purple for the knob and underside of the roof. I attached the door using a piano hinge, and added a magnetic latch (like in a cabinet) to hold the door firmly closed. I wanted to put it out right away, so Trevor made a mounting post after dark and we put it outside with some starter books!</p>' +
			'<p>I\'m excited to see if it gets adopted by the neighborhood, and to watch the books come and go.</p>',

		'title': 'A (New) Roof Over Our Heads',
		'date': 1441861207000,
		'author': 'Trevor',
		'contents' :
			'<p>From day one, we knew our house\'s roof needed replacing.  At the time, we knew this because the roof was over 20 years old.  As time went on, the house really made sure we understood the poor condition of the roof by leaking water into our bathroom every time it rained.  Luckily, it leaked right into the bathtub, so we couldn\'t have asked for a more well-behaved leak.  Still, a leaking roof is a busted roof, so we got a quote for re-roofing many months ago.  Other projects came up, the wet season started, and we delayed the re-roofing.</p>' +
			'<p>Now, finally, we are the proud owners of a new roof!  While that might not seem exciting, the big change is that our roof is now insulated and our house way more comfortable during hot days.  We have no attic in our house, and the ceiling is made of tongue-and-groove boards on exposed rafter beams.  The (black) roofing material was laid directly on top of the boards, and it gets to be like hot lava in the sun.  That means that the only thing separating our living space from the hot roofing material was 1.5 inches of wood.  And wood doesn\'t insulate very well.  So we now have 4 inches of insulating foam between us and the outside world.  Insulation effectiveness is measured by the R-value, and we went from a ceiling R-value of 1 to 26.  Even without knowing what the R-value means, it\'s clear that a 26-fold improvement is pretty good.  Add that to the fact that our roof is now white and decidedly less lava-like on a hot day, and you can see why the interior is so much more comfortable!</p>' +
			'<p>We didn\'t tackle this project ourselves, but there was a lot of prep work to do before the pros arrived for the actual re-roofing.  The fascia trim boards were rotted in some areas and warped in others.  Katie and I decided to just replace all the boards, which was quite a chore.  As it turns out, a 16 foot long 2x10 board weighs a lot!  Katie and I installed about 15 fascia boards in all, which involved removing as many existing fascia boards from the house.  We eventually got the hang of holding those huge boards in place while I nailed them to the house.  It was fairly labor-intensive and involved a lot of really hot work, but I\'m glad we did it.</p>' +
			'<p>Another prep task was to raise our three skylights so that the 4 inches of foam wouldn\'t leave them buried beneath the final roof height.  That was a pretty simple job, although it did involve cutting a hole in our roof.  Well, not exactly cutting a hole but enlarging an existing hole.  At some point in our house\'s long history, new skylights were installed in place of old, smaller skylights.  The holes were not changed for the new skylight form factor, and that made for a funky look on the inside of the house.  I was glad to get the skylight holes to be the right shape and size.  After the holes were done, I built some 4-sided boxes (sort of like rectangular tubes) for the skylights to sit on.</p>' +
			'<p>After that, the roofers came to get rid of the old roof, apply foam, add the white cap sheet material on top, and seal everything.  They did a great job in only a few days, and it was fun to see how they did everything.</p>' +
			'<p>That was one of the bigger projects we had planned, so it is great to have that crossed of our list.</p>',

			'<p>We\'re slowly wrapping up the bathroom after...uh, lots of months of working on it.  A new medicine cabinet brings us one step closer!  We\'ve got a super thick wall behind the bathroom sink, because it contains all of the plumbing for the kitchen and bath.  Most prefabricated medicine cabinets are meant for a standard wall thickness and are about 3 inches deep.  We definitely wanted to take advantage of the extra space in our wall cavity and the only prefab cabinet we could find was over $1000.  Yikes.</p>' +
			'<p>So, I ended up buying a replacement Kohler medicine cabinet door and building my own cabinet box for it.  It\'s a mighty 7.5 inches deep with a built-in outlet for toothbrush charging.  I made a <a href=\"https://cad.onshape.com/documents/6234ec1d2e6d49a59d51a581/w/7c20d64bfb444c53879fd39e/e/305a68844ab2418fad7f3cd0\">3D model</a> of the whole thing beforehand to make sure I got all the measurements right.  The actual construction was pretty simple and fun.  Overall, it only cost us about $270&mdash;very good compared to the store-bought option!</p>',

			'<p>Just a small project this time.  I replaced our front door light and added two more on either side of the garage.  Katie and I took forever to pick the lights we wanted, but once they came in, I wasted no time installing them!  The project was fun and easy.</p>' +
			'<p>I measured out where the lights would go, and then I punched appropriately-sized holes through the exterior stucco into the garage.  Well, ok I didn\'t punch the holes (that would be amazing) I used a flat head screwdriver to chip away the stucco in a round area.  One round electrical box went in each hole (from the interior) and I sealed around the perimeter with caulk.</p>' +
			'<p>Time to run wires!  Our garage walls still have a ton of holes in them from my rewiring project, so I had no problem with removing more drywall to run new wires for the garage door lights. Wiring was pretty straightforward after all the practice I had rewiring the whole house.  One tricky bit was figuring out where the light switch would go.  Long story short, older switch boxes are much shallower than new ones.  I couldn\'t think of how I could replace the single-sized switch box that was currently in the kitchen with a new one that accommodates two switches without having it stick out of the wall.  Turns out, the switch box already there <em>was</em> a double switch box, it just had a single switch installed!  That made everything a lot easier, and our house was looking pretty with its new lights by evening.</p>',
