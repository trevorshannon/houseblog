			'<p>After a hard day at work, I came back and took a hammer and crowbar to explore what the ceiling was made of and how we would get the stuff off.  Turns out it was indeed the wood we had hoped for, painted white.  The drywall was attached with both nails and screws, with a ton of nails holding the curved metal strip in place to make those rounded corners.</p>' +
			'<p>It took about a week, but we managed to get all the drywall off the ceiling without causing too much damage to the wood. (Turns out the slats are redwood!)  We then filled in the holes from the nails and screws with wood filler, sanded the rough spots, and painted the whole thing with primer.</p>' +

			'<p>Trevor saw how disappointed I was, and was excited to open up the washer and investigate what was going on. He found a magical piece of paper that told him the buttons to press to put the washer into \'service mode\', which meant that it did all kinds of things when you spun the dial, like blinking a serial code or spinning or filling with water.  We saw that the hot water filled much faster than the cold, and Trevor quickly diagnosed and fixed the issue: a clogged filter in the cold water input. Now the machine doesn\'t stretch the clothes! Below is Trevor, excited to have fixed the machine.</p>' +

Actually, when we moved in and for the first few days it did work, but at one point I flipped the switch and it just ... didn\'t spin up. This meant our showers made the bathroom more steamy, which probably isn\'t so good for the paint in the long term (not that we want to keep that textured paint around anyway). Yesterday I climbed up on a ladder to fix the fan, assuming it was just too linty to spin. </p>' +

			'<p>During the deconstruction, we decided that the old owners had built this shed originally as a shop or tool shed, because the insides seemed to have yellow pegboard on them. Later, they turned it into a bedroom: the pegboard had been repurposed as a floor, just placed over wooden beams but not attached to them. The shed was carpeted, insulated, finished, and even wallpapered at one time.  It showed signs of having an old hard door with latch, and although there was no electricity we could imagine that someone had slept here. This guess is made more certain by the fact that we know that someone had staying in the garage and in the 8x10 detached back shed.</p>' +
			'<p>My uncle Elliott came over to help with any (de)construction we were doing this weekend. We decided to work on the shed, as the scope of the project seemed appropriate for 3 people in one day. He brought a sledge hammer, gloves, and a lot of extra man-power which made this project possible!</p>' +

			'<p>Removing the drywall went really quickly, but the process slowed down when we got to the stucco. Stucco is basically like cement pushed over chicken wire, so it is both heavy and un-crackable without using wire cutters. It took a few hours to get all the stucco off; in the middle we went for a delicious lunch at the locally-owned Mexican grocery/cafe down the street.</p>' +

			'<p>After the heavy stucco was off, we propped up the roof with long 2x4s and removed the other supporting beams.  Then Trevor and Elliott carefully lowered the roof partway onto two ladders. We re-propped the roof, and they brought it almost-gracefully the rest of the way down (see video below).</p>' +

			'<p>The rest was just deconstruction of the roof, and a whole lot of clean-up. We moved all the materials to the driveway and will have them hauled away tomorrow.  We finished with a glass of fresh-squeezed lemonade from our tree outside and some chips and guacamole from the local grocery. Success!</p>' +

			'<p>Our house came with a teensy electrical panel that probably suited the house quite well when it was built in the 1950\'s.  However, modern times demand more power!  The panel only supported five circuits, and three of them were used&mdash;one for lighting and two more for everything else.  The fourth and fifth slots were actually taken too, but by a 240V circuit that was no longer used in the house (old stove?  water heater?  who knows.) With no room to add more circuit breakers, we had no hope of adding circuits to our electrical system if we didn\'t get a new panel first.</p>' +
			'<p>We figured we only wanted to do this once, so we went for a 200 amp panel.  There are like a billion (ok, maybe 25) available breaker slots, which we will probably never fill up.  However, the 200A panel allows us to maybe one day get solar panels or an electric car or both.</p>' +
			'<p>This is one thing I didn\'t want to do myself, and so after getting a couple of bids I hired a highly-recommended electrician to do the panel replacement.  They spent a day on the job and it came out really well!  We now have a much larger panel on the back of our house and the ability to add circuits as we please.  Now if we can just figure out how to get the new wires inside the walls...</p>',

			'<p>I\'ve seen quite a few hummingbirds around our neighborhood, and think they would come to our house too if we had something to offer them.  In college I made a <a href=\"http://kaytdek.trevorshp.com/graphics/humming/humming.htm\">feeder</a> from plastic bottles and a red Solo cup for petals, and I had quite a few Anna\'s hummingbirds come visit every day.</p>' +
			'<p>This time, I decided to make a hummingbird feeder from a glass bottle, so I could put it in the dishwasher.  Sugar water makes a great place for nasty things to grow, so it is important to clean the feeder frequently and thoroughly.  For this one, the base and petals are from an empty Tide detergent as the plastic seems hard and sturdy and the colors were bright.  However, the base will not be able to go in the dishwasher, so I tried to have as few nooks and crannies as possible to make it easier to clean later.</p>' +
			'<p>Materials & Tools:<br>1 glass bottle with screw-on lid (I used an Orangina bottle)<br>1 plastic Tide detergent with lid<br>Thin wire<br>Hot glue<br>Drill<br>Needle Nosed Pliers<br>Scissors</p>' +
			'<p>I began by drilling 4 very small holes in the Tide lid to attach to the bottle.  I also drilled 4 very small holes in the bottle lid, and one large hole to let the sugar-water flow out.</p>' +
			'<p>I cut lots of small petals from the tide container, then hot-glued them together to make 6-petaled flowers with holes in the middle for the bird to drink.  I made 4 flowers, then glued them all to my tide lid.</p>' +
			'<p>I then threaded 4 thin wires through the 4 small holes in the Tide lid, and attached each thin wire to a hole of the bottle lid.  In retrospect, I should have done this before attaching the flowers to the Tide lid.</p>' +
			'<p>Finally, I made a loop of thin wire and attached three long pieces of wire to that to hold up the bottle.  I made some sugar-water (1:4 sugar:water, boiled) and put it in my Orangina bottle, then screwed the base on upside down.  I brought it outside, inverted it, and hung it on a nail along a rafter outside the kitchen.</p>' +
			'<p>I hope the hummingbirds notice!</p>',
