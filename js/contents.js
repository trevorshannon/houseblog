			'<p>After a hard day at work, I came back and took a hammer and crowbar to explore what the ceiling was made of and how we would get the stuff off.  Turns out it was indeed the wood we had hoped for, painted white.  The drywall was attached with both nails and screws, with a ton of nails holding the curved metal strip in place to make those rounded corners.</p>' +

We then filled in the holes from the nails and screws with wood filler, sanded the rough spots, and painted the whole thing with primer.</p>' +

			'<p>Trevor saw how disappointed I was, and was excited to open up the washer and investigate what was going on. He found a magical piece of paper that told him the buttons to press to put the washer into \'service mode\', which meant that it did all kinds of things when you spun the dial, like blinking a serial code or spinning or filling with water.  We saw that the hot water filled much faster than the cold, and Trevor quickly diagnosed and fixed the issue: a clogged filter in the cold water input. Now the machine doesn\'t stretch the clothes! Below is Trevor, excited to have fixed the machine.</p>' +

Actually, when we moved in and for the first few days it did work, but at one point I flipped the switch and it just ... didn\'t spin up. This meant our showers made the bathroom more steamy, which probably isn\'t so good for the paint in the long term (not that we want to keep that textured paint around anyway). Yesterday I climbed up on a ladder to fix the fan, assuming it was just too linty to spin. </p>' +

			'<p>During the deconstruction, we decided that the old owners had built this shed originally as a shop or tool shed, because the insides seemed to have yellow pegboard on them. Later, they turned it into a bedroom: the pegboard had been repurposed as a floor, just placed over wooden beams but not attached to them. The shed was carpeted, insulated, finished, and even wallpapered at one time.  It showed signs of having an old hard door with latch, and although there was no electricity we could imagine that someone had slept here. This guess is made more certain by the fact that we know that someone had staying in the garage and in the 8x10 detached back shed.</p>' +
			'<p>My uncle Elliott came over to help with any (de)construction we were doing this weekend. We decided to work on the shed, as the scope of the project seemed appropriate for 3 people in one day. He brought a sledge hammer, gloves, and a lot of extra man-power which made this project possible!</p>' +

Stucco is basically like cement pushed over chicken wire, so it is both heavy and un-crackable without using wire cutters.

The fourth and fifth slots were actually taken too, but by a 240V circuit that was no longer used in the house (old stove?  water heater?  who knows.)

In college I made a <a href=\"http://kaytdek.trevorshp.com/graphics/humming/humming.htm\">feeder</a> from plastic bottles and a red Solo cup for petals, and I had quite a few Anna\'s hummingbirds come visit every day.</p>' +
			'<p>This time, I decided to make a hummingbird feeder from a glass bottle, so I could put it in the dishwasher.  Sugar water makes a great place for nasty things to grow, so it is important to clean the feeder frequently and thoroughly.  For this one, the base and petals are from an empty Tide detergent as the plastic seems hard and sturdy and the colors were bright.  However, the base will not be able to go in the dishwasher, so I tried to have as few nooks and crannies as possible to make it easier to clean later.</p>' +
			'<p>Materials & Tools:<br>1 glass bottle with screw-on lid (I used an Orangina bottle)<br>1 plastic Tide detergent with lid<br>Thin wire<br>Hot glue<br>Drill<br>Needle Nosed Pliers<br>Scissors</p>' +
			'<p>I began by drilling 4 very small holes in the Tide lid to attach to the bottle.  I also drilled 4 very small holes in the bottle lid, and one large hole to let the sugar-water flow out.</p>' +
			'<p>I cut lots of small petals from the tide container, then hot-glued them together to make 6-petaled flowers with holes in the middle for the bird to drink.  I made 4 flowers, then glued them all to my tide lid.</p>' +
			'<p>I then threaded 4 thin wires through the 4 small holes in the Tide lid, and attached each thin wire to a hole of the bottle lid.  In retrospect, I should have done this before attaching the flowers to the Tide lid.</p>' +
			'<p>Finally, I made a loop of thin wire and attached three long pieces of wire to that to hold up the bottle.  I made some sugar-water (1:4 sugar:water, boiled) and put it in my Orangina bottle, then screwed the base on upside down.  I brought it outside, inverted it, and hung it on a nail along a rafter outside the kitchen.</p>' +

Well, ok it was hot and sweaty and exhausting, but it was <i>relatively</i> quick and painless.</p>' +
			'<p>Unlike last time, I had an attack plan: go for the nails.  Each sheet of drywall is nailed (or screwed...I still don\'t understand why both were used) to the underlying tongue and groove wood.  By simply removing the nails and screws, the ceiling should just fall off, right?  Sort of.  The ceiling drywall did come down in much larger pieces than last time we attempted this, but it wasn\'t quite that simple. Sometimes the drywall was stuck to the paint, or I didn\'t find that one rogue screw, or the corner was just too tight to remove the nail.</p>' +
			'<p>I found the fasteners with a strong magnet beforehand and marked them with a grease pencil.  That made my work a lot easier down the road, because I could quickly make my way across the ceiling without needing to switch tools at every nail.  Then it was a lot of pulling and making dust until the ceiling was on the floor.  Luckily, I was ready for the mess and installed plastic sheeting with a fan blowing out the window to manage dust.  The plastic sheet also made clean up easy.  It turns out that stuff goes more smoothly when you plan ahead!</p>' +

			'<p>My parents were in town for the long weekend, and this turned out to be the perfect project for us to tackle.  My dad and I thought a lot about the gate\'s design and eventually came up with a pretty good plan and a nice long shopping list for the home improvement store.  The plan was to attach a post to the house wall and a second post to the existing fence for the other side of the gate.  I really wanted to make the entire gate out of wood, as I don\'t like the look of the welded steel gate frames.  So, at the risk of having a saggy gate in a few years, we bought a bunch of redwood and got to work.</p>' +
			'<p>You know that measure twice, cut once thing?  Pretty good idea.  We cut a beautiful fence post out of a 4x4 redwood post&mdash;slanted top for water run-off, counterbored holes for the lag bolts, it was really nice.  Only we couldn\'t attach it to the wall.  It turns out our house\'s foundation is thick.  Really thick.  And it\'s hard to screw a lag bolt into concrete when you\'re expecting a wooden stud.  We ended up putting the bottom lag bolt hole a little too close to the ground, which prevented us from attaching the post to the house as intended.  So, Katie went out to buy another redwood post and we set to work adapting the oops-post for the other side of the gate.</p>' +
			'<p>Once Katie returned with the lumber, we\'d spent a good 3 hours on the project and had...a post bolted to a fence.  Nice work, team!  Things moved faster after that, especially because we had so much practice making the house-side fence post.  Once both posts were up, we measured the opening and planned out the gate doors.  The span was about 6 feet, so we planned for two doors of equal size.  For added strength (and the illusion of professionalism), I opted for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lap_joint\">half lap joints</a> at the corners of the gate door frames.  It was my first time making such a joint, so I got a brand new dado blade just for that.  It was fairly painless (although time consuming) and I\'m really happy with the result.</p>' +
			'<p>The next day, after the glue dried, we cut the diagonal crossbeams and screwed them in place.  Before adding the fence pickets, we figured out where the hinges would go by temporarily hanging the gates.  Then pulled the gates down and attached the pickets.  After re-installing the gates, we just had to add a latch and cane bolt.  We got our neighbor to help out with the cane bolt hole&mdash;it was cool to see a hammer drill at work!</p>' +

			'<p>After <a href=\"index.html#?start=15&end=16\">removing the ceiling drywall</a>, we spent a few days resurfacing the walls.  They had knock-down texture on them which looked terrible, especially because the walls were painted with high-gloss paint.  You\'d have been able to see your reflection in those walls if it weren\'t for all the texture. Resurfacing the walls involves lots of drywall compound (mud).  Like 40 pounds of it!  The idea is to slowly build up the wall by adding thin layers of watered-down mud, and we ended up adding 3 full layers with a fourth in certain troublesome areas.  It\'s not <i>hard</i> work, but it sure does take a lot of time.  We figured we\'d smooth the walls, paint the room, and get trim up in a weekend.  Yea, right.  After about a week and a half, we finished smoothing the walls.  A lot of the work was done by Katie while I built our new <a href=\"index.html#?start=18&end=19\">fence gate</a>.</p>' +
			'<p>Time to prime and paint!  After a lot of pondering and asking of second opinions, we decided to go with a nice yellow color for the room.  It\'s not a very sunny room, so the yellow made it feel much brighter.  The painting was the easy part&mdash;it went on easy, and looks great!</p>' +
			'<p>The trim was harder.  After cutting what seemed like every piece either too short or at the wrong angle, I finished nailing a 5/8\" cove trim around the ceiling.  I kept getting the newly-painted walls all dirty when I installed the trim, so we would probably swap the order on our next room and really leave the painting for the very end.  Luckily, the paint we bought is scrubbable and I was able to clean it right up.  I wasn\'t too happy with the way the mitered corners turned out.  It was very difficult to deal with walls and corners that weren\'t square...I guess that\'s what caulk is for.</p>' +

			'<p>There was a ceiling fan (with lights) in the yellow room before we made it yellow.  Unfortunately, the wire for that fan was run directly along the main ceiling beam, hidden underneath all the drywall Katie and I removed.  So, we had to figure out a different way to get power to the center of the ceiling for our overhead light.</p>' +
			'<p>After much hemming and hawing, I finally agreed that surface mounted indoor conduit doesn\'t really look that bad.  The plan was to run some conduit alongside main ceiling beam, pressed up against the tongue and groove slats.  In order to do that, I needed just a few more inches of wire.  The proper way to extend wire is to add a junction box somewhere and take new wire (as long as you need) from there.  I found out that junction boxes also have to be accessible, and someone suggested (most brilliantly) that if a junction box is needed somewhere, you might as well install an outlet to serve as the junction.  So I did!</p>' +
			'<p>I added an outlet above the closet in our yellow room, which might actually come in handy if we ever convert the space above the closet to a reading nook.  It was my first time doing electrical work on our new house.  It was also my first time cutting holes in freshly-painted drywall... It took forever to actually find the wire in the wall, as there was some weird wall-on-top-of-wall stuff going on (previous renovations, don\'t ask) that put the wire in a very strange place.  I eventually found that devious wire, cut it short, and popped in an outlet box.  Then, I ran new wire back to the ceiling and through indoor conduit to the center of the room.  Looks great so far, it\'s just missing a light fixture.</p>',

			'<p>Another post about the yellow room!  This time it\'s all about the room\'s window.  The window used to have a granite window stool and rounded corners all around. (I learned that the stool is the proper name for that thing I would have called the sill.  Turns out the sill is only on the outdoor side.)  We wanted a cleaner, crisper look, so we bypassed the fancy window trim at the store and picked up some plain ol\' wood to trim our window like shown here.</p>' +
			'<p><a href=\"http://cottagelife.com/files/2012/01/Window-trim-illo-Jacques.jpg\"><img class=\"featuredImage\" alt=\"window trim diagram\" src=\"http://cottagelife.com/files/2012/01/Window-trim-illo-Jacques.jpg\"/></a><br>We got a wide 1x8 for the stool, 1x3\'s for the surrounding trim, a 1x4 for the top piece, and a 1x2 for a little accent strip.  We got poplar for the stool and apron (bottom two pieces of the trim) and softer pine for the more decorative parts of the trim.</p>' +
			'<p>With all the supplies ready, I got to work!  The 1x8 turned out to be a little too wide for the stool, so I trimmed it down to a 1x6, and made a note to just buy a 1x6 when we do the next window.  I cut out clearance for the jamb using a hand saw, as I couldn\'t think of a good way to do it with power tools.  It actually wasn\'t too bad&mdash;the cuts came out pretty straight in the end.  I also used a router table to round the edges of the stool just a bit for durability and comfort.  All the other pieces were simpler than the stool, as I just had to cut them all to length.  I used 2\" finishing nails to install all the bits, and suddenly the window looked a thousand times better!  I also took the opportunity to fill some gaps around the window with insulating foam and replace all the vinyl edging around the window.</p>' +
			'<p>Katie helped prime the trim and then I stayed up late to paint the whole thing the next night.  The window looks so much better than before; Katie and I love it!</p>',

			'<p>The final step for the yellow room was to install an overhead light fixture.  Katie and I decided on a modern globe light because it matched the decor and was easy to mount on a narrow ceiling beam.  I had already prepared the electrical, so all we had to do was mount it.  Easier said than done!  The lighting store ordered a part in the wrong size, so that delayed the project a bit.  When I exchanged the part I also gave back the mounting instructions, because surely the replacement would come with its own set of instructions....right? Well, I eventually figured out how all the bits went together.</p>' +
			'<p>I had to install the fixture without an electrical box.  That\'s not technically allowed, but what\'s one to do when mounting a light onto a solid wooden beam?  I also had to do a bit of customization to allow the surface-mounted wire to enter the light canopy.  Not too big of a job with the proper Dremel attachment.  All in all it was pretty easy to mount the light, and it sure brightens up the room.</p>',

In addition, we saw the ceiling was very cool, and we know our thin roof has no insulation.<br>Trevor did a calculation to determine that about 60% of our heat is lost through the ceiling (as opposed to the walls), so roof insulation sounds like a good project to tackle soon! Armed with this knowledge we will be able to make informed decisions about where to invest in making our house energy-efficient.<br>We also used the Flir camera to see how warm and well insulated our kittens are!

			'<p>When we bought the house, the home inspector said the old heater was in \'poor\' condition -- and I wasn\'t comfortable having it running when we weren\'t home. But we absolutely needed a way to keep the kitties warm if we were gone for a few days during the California \"winter\"!</p>' +
			'<p>Trevor did a lot of research about what type of heater we should get, researching the pros and cons of mini-splits (electric ductless heating systems) and gas heaters, and even bringing home a Flir camera (see previous post) to see where our house was losing the most heat. While the mini-split is hugely efficient and runs on electric power, we decided to go with another gas heater and invest in insulation instead of an expensive heating system. Our house is pretty small, so hopefully with better insulation and the not-so-cold winters we won\'t need to use very much natural gas at all.</p>' +
			'<p>We decided to go with the current version of our same heater, assuming this would mean compatibility of the vent and space between the studs. Then we went out to Home Depot and picked one up!</p>' +
			'<p>First we removed the old heater, and saw that we would need to make some modifications to the new heater\'s legs to avoid the gas pipe and an electrical cord. Then we tried to place the new heater -- it should have slipped right between the studs - but it was just a tad too wide! We bent the mounting fin of one of the legs (non-structural! don\'t worry!), and tried again, and again, and again, until we final bent the fin enough to get the heater to fit.</p>' +
			'<p>Then we carefully hooked up the gas pipe - which thankfully just used the same fittings as the old heater. We tested the connection with soapy water and made sure there were absolutely no gas leaks.</p>' +
			'<p>Then, after connecting the thermostat, it was time to test lighting the pilot light and turning it on! The flames in this heater are tidy and cool looking, and it produced a lot of heat.</p>' +

I found all sorts of things under (and embedded in) the concrete: pudding containers, wrappers, a dead squirrel&mdash;all sorts of stuff.
