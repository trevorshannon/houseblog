The result: a water-proof stall, and the flies seem to have moved out!</p>',

I then took a crowbar and removed the baseboard around the perimeter of the room, exposing some damaged drywall near the bathroom -- the source of the water damage! Trevor put bleach on the old mildewed drywall, and we stayed out of the room for the day.</p>' +

I\'d pick a wire and follow it up to the roof, across the wall, around the corner, back down the wall, into the junction box...only to find it didn\'t connect to anything!  It turned out nearly all the wires were cut at one or both ends, so it really was just dead copper hanging from the walls.</p>' +

			'<p>In all it took a lot of time but wasn\'t so hard.  I\'m ready to go forth and smooth every single other wall in the house, but we can\'t do that until we figure out some other stuff that might damage freshly smoothed walls -- like electrical and ceilings.</p>',
