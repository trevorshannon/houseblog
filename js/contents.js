I\'d pick a wire and follow it up to the roof, across the wall, around the corner, back down the wall, into the junction box...only to find it didn\'t connect to anything!  It turned out nearly all the wires were cut at one or both ends, so it really was just dead copper hanging from the walls.</p>' +
