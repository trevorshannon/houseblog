			'<p>After a hard day at work, I came back and took a hammer and crowbar to explore what the ceiling was made of and how we would get the stuff off.  Turns out it was indeed the wood we had hoped for, painted white.  The drywall was attached with both nails and screws, with a ton of nails holding the curved metal strip in place to make those rounded corners.</p>' +

We then filled in the holes from the nails and screws with wood filler, sanded the rough spots, and painted the whole thing with primer.</p>' +

			'<p>Trevor saw how disappointed I was, and was excited to open up the washer and investigate what was going on. He found a magical piece of paper that told him the buttons to press to put the washer into \'service mode\', which meant that it did all kinds of things when you spun the dial, like blinking a serial code or spinning or filling with water.  We saw that the hot water filled much faster than the cold, and Trevor quickly diagnosed and fixed the issue: a clogged filter in the cold water input. Now the machine doesn\'t stretch the clothes! Below is Trevor, excited to have fixed the machine.</p>' +

Actually, when we moved in and for the first few days it did work, but at one point I flipped the switch and it just ... didn\'t spin up. This meant our showers made the bathroom more steamy, which probably isn\'t so good for the paint in the long term (not that we want to keep that textured paint around anyway). Yesterday I climbed up on a ladder to fix the fan, assuming it was just too linty to spin. </p>' +

			'<p>During the deconstruction, we decided that the old owners had built this shed originally as a shop or tool shed, because the insides seemed to have yellow pegboard on them. Later, they turned it into a bedroom: the pegboard had been repurposed as a floor, just placed over wooden beams but not attached to them. The shed was carpeted, insulated, finished, and even wallpapered at one time.  It showed signs of having an old hard door with latch, and although there was no electricity we could imagine that someone had slept here. This guess is made more certain by the fact that we know that someone had staying in the garage and in the 8x10 detached back shed.</p>' +
			'<p>My uncle Elliott came over to help with any (de)construction we were doing this weekend. We decided to work on the shed, as the scope of the project seemed appropriate for 3 people in one day. He brought a sledge hammer, gloves, and a lot of extra man-power which made this project possible!</p>' +

Stucco is basically like cement pushed over chicken wire, so it is both heavy and un-crackable without using wire cutters.

The fourth and fifth slots were actually taken too, but by a 240V circuit that was no longer used in the house (old stove?  water heater?  who knows.)

In college I made a <a href=\"http://kaytdek.trevorshp.com/graphics/humming/humming.htm\">feeder</a> from plastic bottles and a red Solo cup for petals, and I had quite a few Anna\'s hummingbirds come visit every day.</p>' +
			'<p>This time, I decided to make a hummingbird feeder from a glass bottle, so I could put it in the dishwasher.  Sugar water makes a great place for nasty things to grow, so it is important to clean the feeder frequently and thoroughly.  For this one, the base and petals are from an empty Tide detergent as the plastic seems hard and sturdy and the colors were bright.  However, the base will not be able to go in the dishwasher, so I tried to have as few nooks and crannies as possible to make it easier to clean later.</p>' +
			'<p>Materials & Tools:<br>1 glass bottle with screw-on lid (I used an Orangina bottle)<br>1 plastic Tide detergent with lid<br>Thin wire<br>Hot glue<br>Drill<br>Needle Nosed Pliers<br>Scissors</p>' +
			'<p>I began by drilling 4 very small holes in the Tide lid to attach to the bottle.  I also drilled 4 very small holes in the bottle lid, and one large hole to let the sugar-water flow out.</p>' +
			'<p>I cut lots of small petals from the tide container, then hot-glued them together to make 6-petaled flowers with holes in the middle for the bird to drink.  I made 4 flowers, then glued them all to my tide lid.</p>' +
			'<p>I then threaded 4 thin wires through the 4 small holes in the Tide lid, and attached each thin wire to a hole of the bottle lid.  In retrospect, I should have done this before attaching the flowers to the Tide lid.</p>' +
			'<p>Finally, I made a loop of thin wire and attached three long pieces of wire to that to hold up the bottle.  I made some sugar-water (1:4 sugar:water, boiled) and put it in my Orangina bottle, then screwed the base on upside down.  I brought it outside, inverted it, and hung it on a nail along a rafter outside the kitchen.</p>' +

Well, ok it was hot and sweaty and exhausting, but it was <i>relatively</i> quick and painless.</p>' +
			'<p>Unlike last time, I had an attack plan: go for the nails.  Each sheet of drywall is nailed (or screwed...I still don\'t understand why both were used) to the underlying tongue and groove wood.  By simply removing the nails and screws, the ceiling should just fall off, right?  Sort of.  The ceiling drywall did come down in much larger pieces than last time we attempted this, but it wasn\'t quite that simple. Sometimes the drywall was stuck to the paint, or I didn\'t find that one rogue screw, or the corner was just too tight to remove the nail.</p>' +
			'<p>I found the fasteners with a strong magnet beforehand and marked them with a grease pencil.  That made my work a lot easier down the road, because I could quickly make my way across the ceiling without needing to switch tools at every nail.  Then it was a lot of pulling and making dust until the ceiling was on the floor.  Luckily, I was ready for the mess and installed plastic sheeting with a fan blowing out the window to manage dust.  The plastic sheet also made clean up easy.  It turns out that stuff goes more smoothly when you plan ahead!</p>' +

			'<p>My parents were in town for the long weekend, and this turned out to be the perfect project for us to tackle.  My dad and I thought a lot about the gate\'s design and eventually came up with a pretty good plan and a nice long shopping list for the home improvement store.  The plan was to attach a post to the house wall and a second post to the existing fence for the other side of the gate.  I really wanted to make the entire gate out of wood, as I don\'t like the look of the welded steel gate frames.  So, at the risk of having a saggy gate in a few years, we bought a bunch of redwood and got to work.</p>' +
			'<p>You know that measure twice, cut once thing?  Pretty good idea.  We cut a beautiful fence post out of a 4x4 redwood post&mdash;slanted top for water run-off, counterbored holes for the lag bolts, it was really nice.  Only we couldn\'t attach it to the wall.  It turns out our house\'s foundation is thick.  Really thick.  And it\'s hard to screw a lag bolt into concrete when you\'re expecting a wooden stud.  We ended up putting the bottom lag bolt hole a little too close to the ground, which prevented us from attaching the post to the house as intended.  So, Katie went out to buy another redwood post and we set to work adapting the oops-post for the other side of the gate.</p>' +
			'<p>Once Katie returned with the lumber, we\'d spent a good 3 hours on the project and had...a post bolted to a fence.  Nice work, team!  Things moved faster after that, especially because we had so much practice making the house-side fence post.  Once both posts were up, we measured the opening and planned out the gate doors.  The span was about 6 feet, so we planned for two doors of equal size.  For added strength (and the illusion of professionalism), I opted for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lap_joint\">half lap joints</a> at the corners of the gate door frames.  It was my first time making such a joint, so I got a brand new dado blade just for that.  It was fairly painless (although time consuming) and I\'m really happy with the result.</p>' +
			'<p>The next day, after the glue dried, we cut the diagonal crossbeams and screwed them in place.  Before adding the fence pickets, we figured out where the hinges would go by temporarily hanging the gates.  Then pulled the gates down and attached the pickets.  After re-installing the gates, we just had to add a latch and cane bolt.  We got our neighbor to help out with the cane bolt hole&mdash;it was cool to see a hammer drill at work!</p>' +

			'<p>After <a href=\"index.html#?start=15&end=16\">removing the ceiling drywall</a>, we spent a few days resurfacing the walls.  They had knock-down texture on them which looked terrible, especially because the walls were painted with high-gloss paint.  You\'d have been able to see your reflection in those walls if it weren\'t for all the texture. Resurfacing the walls involves lots of drywall compound (mud).  Like 40 pounds of it!  The idea is to slowly build up the wall by adding thin layers of watered-down mud, and we ended up adding 3 full layers with a fourth in certain troublesome areas.  It\'s not <i>hard</i> work, but it sure does take a lot of time.  We figured we\'d smooth the walls, paint the room, and get trim up in a weekend.  Yea, right.  After about a week and a half, we finished smoothing the walls.  A lot of the work was done by Katie while I built our new <a href=\"index.html#?start=18&end=19\">fence gate</a>.</p>' +
			'<p>Time to prime and paint!  After a lot of pondering and asking of second opinions, we decided to go with a nice yellow color for the room.  It\'s not a very sunny room, so the yellow made it feel much brighter.  The painting was the easy part&mdash;it went on easy, and looks great!</p>' +
			'<p>The trim was harder.  After cutting what seemed like every piece either too short or at the wrong angle, I finished nailing a 5/8\" cove trim around the ceiling.  I kept getting the newly-painted walls all dirty when I installed the trim, so we would probably swap the order on our next room and really leave the painting for the very end.  Luckily, the paint we bought is scrubbable and I was able to clean it right up.  I wasn\'t too happy with the way the mitered corners turned out.  It was very difficult to deal with walls and corners that weren\'t square...I guess that\'s what caulk is for.</p>' +
